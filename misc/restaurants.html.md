Most of the engineering teams are located in Glendale, CA.
Glendale (Eastern end of the San Fernando Valley) is the 3rd largest city in Los Angeles with 191,719 people.
Also a home for the largest Armenian population.  (1 in 4 are Armenian!)
With a large city comes big demands for great places to get your "grub' on".

Here are my picks for the best eateries in town:

### Porto's Bakery  
315 N Brand Blvd, Glendale, CA 91203 
Price Range:  $

This place is no itty bitty bakery!  20,000 square feet of mouth watering desserts, sandwiches, soups, coffee!  You can find Cuban, French, Danish, and Italian delicacies here at Porto's Bakery.  A ffamily run business since the 1990's, this jem brings in thousands of people from all over Southern California and has now grown into 2 other cities.  You are missing out if you haven't given this place a try.  Go support a local family business.

### Raffi's Place Restaurant  
211 E Broadway, Glendale, CA 91205

Raffi's place is a unique place the best Persian food in the valley.  Kabob Bargh (fillet Mignon), Kabob Koobideh (ground meat), Mast o moosir(yogurt and shallots), Basmati rice, Baklava, Soltani kabob(fillet Mignon and ground beef), hummus..... need I say more???  This place is packed every night but it is worth the wait!

I have always been a fan of Japanese food and my wife and I have tried some highly recommended Japanese restaurants in Southern California and I must say that this is one of the best.  So who cares if this place is ridiculously expensive right?  If you want FRESH fish this is the place to go in the valley.  This place does not match the price tag to the rent they pay as it is located in a run down strip mall but we all know that sometimes these kind of places are better than the fancy schmancy restaurants.  Omakase in Japanese is a phrase they use to say "I'll leave it to you".  This restaurant is unique in that everything is "omakase" and the sushi chef will only serve you the freshest fish of the day.  If you are like my wife and can only eat California rolls and specialty rolls you will go home hungry!  Some people compare Sushi Nishiya to authentic sushi restaurants in Japan.   Listen to me and SAVE your money for several weeks and go here, you will not regret it.  

**HAPPY EATING EVERYONE!**
